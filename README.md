### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Introduce yourself and give a brief introduction about yourself here.  Also include what tech you're interested in and what you are currently learning -->
With over 10 years of experience in **DevSecOps Engineering** and software
development, I have focused on **Build, Release, Continuous Integration, Cloud Web
Service, Deployment Automation, Release Management**, and Cloud
Implementation software configuration management. I have extensive experience
in **DevOps**, including setting up enterprise infrastructure on **Kubernetes** and **Docker**
Swarm using **Helm, Puppet, and Ansible instances, Security Groups, Auto Scaling
code Developing**, and Application Software Versioning on **Git**. I have experience in
branching, merging, and maintaining versions using SCM tools such as **GitLab** and
**GitHub** on the Linux platform. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with **EC2,
S3, RDS, VPC, ELB, EBS, and Auto Scaling**, as well as full scaling on **Atlassian** and
**Microsoft Azure DevOps** Platform Services (**On-prem** or **Cloud**) in Project
Management, issue tracking, and Documentary tools.
I have experience creating **Docker containers** and **Docker consoles** to manage the
application **lifecycle**, as well as creating custom Docker Images using Dockerfile for
easier replication of DEV and QA Environments on local machines. I have
performed and deployed builds for **various Environments** such as **QA, Integration,
UAT, and Production Environments**, and developed and deployed **Chef, Puppet**
based on their cookbooks, recipes, and manifest. I have also configured and
monitored distributed and multi-platform servers using Nagios.
My strong analytical and problem-solving skills enable me to work independently
with little or no supervision or as a member of a team. I have extensive experience
ensuring visitors to online services have a safe experience and their personal data is
secure, as well as protecting corporate data and employees' equipment. Protecting
customer and company information is an essential part of my role, and I am
passionate about improving it while creating a secure environment without
restricting or slowing down business processes.
